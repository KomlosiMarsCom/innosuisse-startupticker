# INNOSUISSE & STARTUPTICKER
# Empowering Swiss start-ups and investors with AI-driven data insights

Startupticker has a large, reliable data set on Swiss startups. This data is only used for reports and is otherwise not available. We see huge untapped potential in making this data available to start-ups, investors and support organisations. It would be ideal for creating more transparency in the ecosystem. There is also great potential for semantic search.

* Use case 1: Recognising trends
Recognising trends with semantic search: Investors and startups want to know how a sector or vertical has developed, for example to recognise whether there are signs of a recovery in investments or whether rising valuations or a wave of startups looking for investors can be expected

* Use case 2: Benchmarking
Investors and support organisations want to know whether the startups in their portfolio are performing better or worse than average. As all other content by Startupticker, the analyses will be offered for free.

## Expected Outcome:

There are two possibilities: 
Recognising trends with semantic search 
Ontology instead of standard classification for the three data sets
Step 1: create a model to organise descriptors/tags 
Step 2: develop algorithms able to hat capture them 

Benchmarking
Dashboard on the Startupticker website for users to perform simple analyses

Format: 
* Presentation with slides and short live demo if possible
Key elements:
* Concept, functionality, examples, description of the necessary work up to the finished product
Requirements:
* The prototype is far more relevant than the presentation itself


## Data:
The Startupticker database includes data of more than 5000 Swiss start-ups. The datasets include Founding year, sector, canton, website. In addition, we have a comprehensive database of transactions since 2012 which includes funding rounds, acquisitions and liquidations.
We will provide the database in an excel file.

### Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce

The Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SOGC) is a public database containing information about legal form, ownership and management of the companies and legal entities registered there. It can be accessed here: https://www.shab.ch/#!/search/publications. This database can be useful for information such as the names of the founders, citizenships of the founders and official liquidations, current residence address and changes to the corporate structure of companies. 

Due to a change of the database on the 02. September 2018, the archive has to be visited for information prior to this date. This can be accessed here: https://www.shab.ch/#!/search/archive.

Here you find more information about how to use it: [How to use the SOGC.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19537068/How.to.use.the.SOGC.pdf).
