# INNOSUISSE & STARTUPTICKER
# Empowering Swiss start-ups and investors with AI-driven data insights

Startupticker has a large, reliable data set on Swiss startups. This data is only used for reports and is otherwise not available. We see huge untapped potential in making this data available to start-ups, investors and support organisations. It would be ideal for creating more transparency in the ecosystem. There is also great potential for refining the data.

* Use case 1: Recognising trends
Investors and startups want to know how a sector or vertical has developed, for example to recognise whether there are signs of a recovery in investments or whether rising valuations or a wave of startups looking for investors can be expected.

* Use case 2: Benchmarking
Investors and support organisations want to know whether the startups in their portfolio are performing better or worse than average. As all other content by Startupticker, the analyses will be offered for free.

## Expected Outcome:

There are several possibilities: 1) an interface on the Startupticker website for simple analyses based on the data 2) Refining the existing data by adding verticals or categorizations.

Format: 
* Presentation with slides and short live demo if possible
Key elements:
* Concept, functionality, examples, description of the necessary work up to the finished product
Requirements:
* The prototype is far more relevant than the presentation itself


## Data:
The Startupticker database includes data of more than 5000 Swiss start-ups. The datasets include Founding year, sector, canton, website. In addition, we have a comprehensive database of transactions since 2012 which includes funding rounds, acquisitions and liquidations.
We will provide the database in an excel file.
